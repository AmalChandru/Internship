# A Creative & Innovative frontend clone of https://zstream.in.

After going through the official website and the criteria of the project, I made up my mind to built a much more dynamic and simpler UI.
I implemented my usual method of cloning, i.e making template files in both HTML & CSS and make React components out of it.
Making of React components to show up the fullscreen video in the background using video tags was a little bit tricky.

Tools used :

1.  VS Code
2.  Google Dev Tools
3.  Docz(For documenting React Components)

And I have used the League of Legends Trailer clip as the background Video The clone is definitely the byproduct of my zeal towards minimalism and at the same time obeys notions of criteria given.
